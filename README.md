Web Demo : [Click Here!](https://nervous-heisenberg-d558d2.netlify.app/)

### `BACKLOGS DONE SO FAR`
1. Visualizing the real-time data from the api to maps using Mapbox for React.
2. Tapping on the custom markers would reveal the in-depth insights of the virus.
3. Being an ardent fan of Dark Modes, ended up implementing a dark map.
(Quite contented that I don't wanna spare time in making this site responsive :lol:)
